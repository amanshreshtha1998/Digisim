Circuit implementation of “Merge Sort” algorithm

Designed and simulated a digital circuit to implement the “Merge Sort” algorithm. Six 8-bit binary numbers
are read from ROM and are finally arranged in an ascending order in separate registers. The circuit was
simulated in Proteus software and works for both signed and unsigned numbers
